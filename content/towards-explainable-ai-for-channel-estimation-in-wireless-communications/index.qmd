description: Research into 6G networks has been initiated to support a variety of
  critical artificial intelligence (AI) assisted applications such as autonomous driving.
  In such applications, AI-based decisions should be performed in a real-time manner.
  These decisions include resource allocation, localization, channel estimation, etc.
  Considering the black-box nature of existing AI-based models, it is highly challenging
  to understand and trust the decision-making behavior of such models. Therefore,
  explaining the logic behind those models through explainable AI (XAI) techniques
  is essential for their employment in critical applications. This manuscript proposes
  a novel XAI-based channel estimation (XAI-CHEST) scheme that provides detailed reasonable
  interpretability of the deep learning (DL) models that are employed in doubly-selective
  channel estimation. The aim of the proposed XAI-CHEST scheme is to identify the
  relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. As a result,
  the behavior of the studied DL-based channel estimators can be further analyzed
  and evaluated based on the generated interpretations. Simulation results show that
  the proposed XAI-CHEST scheme provides valid interpretations of the DL-based channel
  estimators for different scenarios.
