  where $\textrm{ker}(\chi)$is the kernel of $\chi$. In this paper, we show that if

  group and $G$ isany finite group such that the character codegree sets of $G$ and
  $H$ coincide,then $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.

For a finite group $G$ and an irreducible complex character $\chi$ of $G$,the codegree of $\chi$ is defined by$\textrm{cod}(\chi)=|G:\textrm{ker}(\chi)|/\chi(1)$, where $\textrm{ker}(\chi)$is the kernel of $\chi$. In this paper, we show that if $H$ is a finite simpleexceptional group of Lie type or a projective special linear group and $G$ isany finite group such that the character codegree sets of $G$ and $H$ coincide,then $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.
