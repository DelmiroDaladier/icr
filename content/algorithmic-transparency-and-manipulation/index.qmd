description: A series of recent papers raises worries about the manipulative potential
  ofalgorithmic transparency. But while the concern is apt and relevant, it isbased
  on a fraught understanding of manipulation. Therefore, this paper drawsattention
  to the indifference view of manipulation, which explains better thanthe vulnerability
  view why algorithmic transparency has manipulative potential.The paper also raises
  pertinent research questions for future studies ofmanipulation in the context of
  algorithmic transparency.
