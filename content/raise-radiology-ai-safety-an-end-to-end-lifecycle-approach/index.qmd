  and educating radiologists about newalgorithmic-driven findings is critical for

  to the same rigorous safety, effectiveness and efficacystandards as other established
  medical technologies. By doing so, developerscan instil confidence among providers
  and patients alike, enabling theresponsible scaling of AI and the realization of
  its potential benefits. Theroadmap presented herein aims to expedite the achievement
