description: In recent years, functional magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as
  apowerful tool for investigating the human brain's functional connectivitynetworks.
  Related studies demonstrate that functional connectivity networks inthe human brain
  can help to improve the efficiency of diagnosing neurologicaldisorders. However,
  there still exist two challenges that limit the progress offunctional neuroimaging.
  Firstly, there exists an abundance of noise andredundant information in functional
  connectivity data, resulting in poorperformance. Secondly, existing brain network
  models have tended to prioritizeeither classification performance or the interpretation
  of neurosciencefindings behind the learned models. To deal with these challenges,
  this paperproposes a novel brain graph learning framework called Template-induced
  BrainGraph Learning (TiBGL), which has both discriminative and interpretableabilities.
  Motivated by the related medical findings on functionalconnectivites, TiBGL proposes
  template-induced brain graph learning to extracttemplate brain graphs for all groups.
  The template graph can be regarded as anaugmentation process on brain networks that
  removes noise information andhighlights important connectivity patterns. To simultaneously
  support the tasksof discrimination and interpretation, TiBGL further develops template-inducedconvolutional
  neural network and template-induced brain interpretationanalysis. Especially, the
  former fuses rich information from brain graphs andtemplate brain graphs for brain
  disorder tasks, and the latter can provideinsightful connectivity patterns related
  to brain disorders based on templatebrain graphs. Experimental results on three
  real-world datasets show that theproposed TiBGL can achieve superior performance
  compared with ninestate-of-the-art methods and keep coherent with neuroscience findings
  in recentliteratures.
