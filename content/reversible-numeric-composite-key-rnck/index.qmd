description: In database design, Composite Keys are used to uniquely identify records
  andprevent data duplication. However, they require more memory and storage spacethan
  single keys, and can make queries more CPU-intensive. Surrogate Keys arean alternative
  that can overcome some of these limitations, but they can alsointroduce new disadvantages.
  To address these challenges, a new type of keycalled a Reversible Numeric Composite
  Key (RNCK) has been developed. RNCK is asingle number that encodes multiple data
  attributes, and can be decoded back tothe original values. This makes it possible
  to achieve the benefits of bothComposite Keys and Surrogate Keys, while overcoming
  some of their limitations.RNCK has been shown to improve query performance and reduce
  memory and storagerequirements. It can be used in relational databases, large static
  datasets,and key-value caching systems. RNCK has been successfully used in productionsystems
  for several years.
