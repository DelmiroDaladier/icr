description: What spectral conditions imply a graph contains a chorded cycle? Thisquestion
  was asked by R.J. Gould in 2022. We answer three modified versions ofGould's question
  by giving tight spectral conditions that imply the existenceof doubly chorded cycle,
  a doubly chorded cycle with two chords incident to avertex, and a doubly chorded
  cycle on five vertices with two chords incident toone vertex, in a graph, respectively.
