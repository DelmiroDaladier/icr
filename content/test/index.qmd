description: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems should be tested ideally using
  diverse speech test data. A promising alternative to produce such test data is to
  synthesize speeches from diverse sentences and speakers. However, despite the great
  amount of test data that can be produced, not all speeches are equally relevant.
  This paper proposes a two-level Item Response Theory (IRT) model to simultaneously
  evaluate ASR systems, speakers and sentences.

title: A two-level Item Response Theory model to evaluate speech synthesis and recognition

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems should be tested ideally using diverse speech test data. A promising alternative to produce such test data is to synthesize speeches from diverse sentences and speakers. However, despite the great amount of test data that can be produced, not all speeches are equally relevant. This paper proposes a two-level Item Response Theory (IRT) model to simultaneously evaluate ASR systems, speakers and sentences.
