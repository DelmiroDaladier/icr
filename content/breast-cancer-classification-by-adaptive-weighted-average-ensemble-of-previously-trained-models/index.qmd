description: Breast cancer is a serious disease that inflicts millions of people eachyear,
  and the number of cases is increasing. Early detection is the best way toreduce
  the impact of the disease. Researchers have developed many techniques todetect breast
  cancer, including the use of histopathology images in CADsystems. This research
  proposes a technique that combine already fully trainedmodel using adaptive average
  ensemble, this is different from the literaturewhich uses average ensemble before
  training and the average ensemble is trainedsimultaneously. Our approach is different
  because it used adaptive averageensemble after training which has increased the
  performance of evaluationmetrics. It averages the outputs of every trained model,
  and every model willhave weight according to its accuracy. The accuracy in the adaptive
  weightedensemble model has achieved 98% where the accuracy has increased by 1 percentwhich
  is better than the best participating model in the ensemble which was97%. Also,
  it decreased the numbers of false positive and false negative andenhanced the performance
  metrics.
