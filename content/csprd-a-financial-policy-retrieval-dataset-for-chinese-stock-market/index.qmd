description: In recent years, great advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
  havesparked considerable research focus and achieved promising performance on theapproach
  of dense passage retrieval, which aims at retrieving relative passagesfrom massive
  corpus with given questions. However, most of existing datasetsmainly benchmark
  the models with factoid queries of general commonsense, whilespecialised fields
  such as finance and economics remain unexplored due to thedeficiency of large-scale
  and high-quality datasets with expert annotations. Inthis work, we propose a new
  task, policy retrieval, by introducing the ChineseStock Policy Retrieval Dataset
  (CSPRD), which provides 700+ prospectus passageslabeled by experienced experts with
  relevant articles from 10k+ entries in ourcollected Chinese policy corpus. Experiments
  on lexical, embedding andfine-tuned bi-encoder models show the effectiveness of
