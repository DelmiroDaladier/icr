Local news articles are a subset of news that impact users in a geographicalarea, such as a city, county, or state. Detecting local news (Step 1) andsubsequently deciding its geographical location as well as radius of impact(Step 2) are two important steps towards accurate local news recommendation.Naive rule-based methods, such as detecting city names from the news title,tend to give erroneous results due to lack of understanding of the newscontent. Empowered by the latest development in natural language processing, wedevelop an integrated pipeline that enables automatic local news detection andcontent-based local news recommendations.
