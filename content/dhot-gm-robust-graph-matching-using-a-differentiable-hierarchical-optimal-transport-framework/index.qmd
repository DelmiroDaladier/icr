description: Graph matching is one of the most significant graph analytic tasks inpractice,
  which aims to find the node correspondence across different graphs.Most existing
  approaches rely on adjacency matrices or node embeddings whenmatching graphs, whose
  performances are often sub-optimal because of not fullyleveraging the multi-modal
  information hidden in graphs, such as nodeattributes, subgraph structures, etc.
  In this study, we propose a novel andeffective graph matching method based on a
  differentiable hierarchical optimaltransport (HOT) framework, called DHOT-GM. Essentially,
  our method representseach graph as a set of relational matrices corresponding to
  the information ofdifferent modalities. Given two graphs, we enumerate all relational
  matrixpairs and obtain their matching results, and accordingly, infer the nodecorrespondence
  by the weighted averaging of the matching results. This methodcan be implemented
  as computing the HOT distance between the two graphs -- eachmatching result is an
  optimal transport plan associated with theGromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance between
  two relational matrices, and theweights of all matching results are the elements
  of an upper-level optimaltransport plan defined on the matrix sets. We propose a
  bi-level optimizationalgorithm to compute the HOT distance in a differentiable way,
  making thesignificance of the relational matrices adjustable. Experiments on variousgraph
  matching tasks demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our methodcompared
  to state-of-the-art approaches.
