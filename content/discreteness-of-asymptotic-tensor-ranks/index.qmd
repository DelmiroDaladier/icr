Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers,often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in severalareas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrixmultiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost anddistillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets,sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptoticslice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai,Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigatednotions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values ofsuch tensor parameters.We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters oforder-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field, theasymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points,and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulationpoints.Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptoticsubrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized.
