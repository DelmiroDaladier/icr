description: Fuzzy Fingerprints have been successfully used as an interpretable textclassification
  technique, but, like most other techniques, have been largelysurpassed in performance
  by Large Pre-trained Language Models, such as BERT orRoBERTa. These models deliver
  state-of-the-art results in several NaturalLanguage Processing tasks, namely Emotion
  Recognition in Conversations (ERC),but suffer from the lack of interpretability
  and explainability. In this paper,we propose to combine the two approaches to perform
  ERC, as a means to obtainsimpler and more interpretable Large Language Models-based
  classifiers. Wepropose to feed the utterances and their previous conversational
  turns to apre-trained RoBERTa, obtaining contextual embedding utterance representations,that
  are then supplied to an adapted Fuzzy Fingerprint classification module.We validate
  our approach on the widely used DailyDialog ERC benchmark dataset,in which we obtain
  state-of-the-art level results using a much lighter model.
