description: As pointed out by several scholars, current research on hate speech (HS)recognition
  is characterized by unsystematic data creation strategies anddiverging annotation
  schemata. Subsequently, supervised-learning models tend togeneralize poorly to datasets
  they were not trained on, and the performance ofthe models trained on datasets labeled
  using different HS taxonomies cannot becompared. To ease this problem, we propose
  applying extremely weak supervisionthat only relies on the class name rather than
  on class samples from theannotated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a state-of-the-artweakly-supervised
  text classification model in various in-dataset andcross-dataset settings. Furthermore,
  we conduct an in-depth quantitative andqualitative analysis of the source of poor
  generalizability of HSclassification models.
