description: Over the years, there has been a paradigm shift in how users access financialservices.
  With the advancement of digitalization more users have beenpreferring the online
  mode of performing financial activities. This has led tothe generation of a huge
  volume of financial content. Most investors prefer togo through these contents before
  making decisions. Every industry has termsthat are specific to the domain it operates
  in. Banking and Financial Servicesare not an exception to this. In order to fully
  comprehend these contents, oneneeds to have a thorough understanding of the financial
  terms. Getting a basicidea about a term becomes easy when it is explained with the
  help of the broadcategory to which it belongs. This broad category is referred to
  as hypernym.For example, "bond" is a hypernym of the financial term "alternativedebenture".
  In this paper, we propose a system capable of extracting andranking hypernyms for
  a given financial term. The system has been trained withfinancial text corpora obtained
  from various sources like DBpedia [4],Investopedia, Financial Industry Business
  Ontology (FIBO), prospectus and soon. Embeddings of these terms have been extracted
  using FinBERT [3], FinISH [1]and fine-tuned using SentenceBERT [54]. A novel approach
  has been used toaugment the training set with negative samples. It uses the hierarchy
  presentin FIBO. Finally, we benchmark the system performance with that of the existingones.
  We establish that it performs better than the existing ones and is alsoscalable.
