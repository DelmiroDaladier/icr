We study point-to-point distance estimation in hypergraphs, where the queryis parameterized by a positive integer s, which defines the required level ofoverlap for two hyperedges to be considered adjacent. To answer s-distancequeries, we first explore an oracle based on the line graph of the givenhypergraph and discuss its limitations: the main one is that the line graph istypically orders of magnitude larger than the original hypergraph. We thenintroduce HypED, a landmark-based oracle with a predefined size, built directlyon the hypergraph, thus avoiding constructing the line graph. Our frameworkallows to approximately answer vertex-to-vertex, vertex-to-hyperedge, andhyperedge-to-hyperedge s-distance queries for any value of s.
