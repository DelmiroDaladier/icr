  Distributions

## Tldr 
An abstraction can be used to relate two structural causal modelsrepresenting the same system at different levels of resolution. Learningabstractions which guarantee consistency with respect to interventionaldistributions would allow one to jointly reason about evidence across multiplelevels of granularity while respecting the underlying cause-effectrelationships. In this paper, we introduce a first framework for causalabstraction learning between SCMs based on the formalization of abstractionrecently proposed by Rischel (2020). Based on that, we propose a differentiableprogramming solution that jointly solves a number of combinatorialsub-problems, and we study its performance and benefits against independent andsequential approaches on synthetic settings and on a challenging real-worldproblem related to electric vehicle battery manufacturing.
