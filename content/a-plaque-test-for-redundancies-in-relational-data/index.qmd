description: Inspired by the visualization of dental plaque at the dentist's office,
  this article proposes a novel visualization technique for identifying redundancies
  in relational data. Our approach builds upon an established information-theoretic
  framework that, despite being well-principled, remains unexplored in practical applications.
  In this framework, we calculate the information content (or entropy) of each cell
  in a relation instance, given a set of functional dependencies. The entropy value
  represents the likelihood of inferring the cell's value based on the dependencies
  and the remaining tuples. By highlighting cells with lower entropy, we effectively
  visualize redundancies in the data. We present an initial prototype implementation
  and demonstrate that a straightforward approach is insufficient for handling practical
  problem sizes. To address this limitation, we propose several optimizations, which
  we prove to be correct. Additionally, we present a Monte Carlo approximation technique
  with a known error, enabling computationally tractable computations. Using a real-world
  dataset of modest size, we illustrate the potential of our visualization technique.
  Our vision is to support domain experts with data profiling and data cleaning tasks,
  akin to the functionality of a plaque test at the dentist's.
