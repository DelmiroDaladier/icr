description: We study the approximability of computing the partition functions oftwo-state
  spin systems. The problem is parameterized by a $2\times 2$ symmetricmatrix. Previous
  results on this problem were restricted either to the casewhere the matrix has non-negative
  entries, or to the case where the diagonalentries are equal, i.e. Ising models.
  In this paper, we study thegeneralization to arbitrary $2\times 2$ interaction matrices
  with real entries.We show that in some regions of the parameter space, it's \#P-hard
  to evendetermine the sign of the partition function, while in other regions there
  arefully polynomial approximation schemes for the partition function. Our resultsreveal
  several new computational phase transitions.
