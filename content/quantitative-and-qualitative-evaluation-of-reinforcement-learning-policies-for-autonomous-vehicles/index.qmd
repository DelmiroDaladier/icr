description: Optimizing traffic dynamics in an evolving transportation landscape iscrucial,
  particularly in scenarios where autonomous vehicles (AVs) with varyinglevels of
  autonomy coexist with human-driven cars. This paper presents a novelapproach to
  optimizing choices of AVs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),a reinforcement
  learning algorithm. We learned a policy to minimize trafficjams (i.e., minimize
  the time to cross the scenario) and to minimize pollutionin a roundabout in Milan,
  Italy. Through empirical analysis, we demonstratethat our approach can reduce time
  and pollution levels. Furthermore, wequalitatively evaluate the learned policy using
  a cutting-edge cockpit toassess its performance in near-real-world conditions. To
  gauge the practicalityand acceptability of the policy, we conducted evaluations
  with humanparticipants using the simulator, focusing on a range of metrics like
  trafficsmoothness and safety perception. In general, our findings show thathuman-driven
  vehicles benefit from optimizing AVs dynamics. Also, participantsin the study highlighted
  that the scenario with 80\% AVs is perceived as saferthan the scenario with 20\%.
  The same result is obtained for traffic smoothnessperception.
