description: '3D reconstruction of the liver for volumetry is important for qualitativeanalysis
  and disease diagnosis. Liver volumetry using ultrasound (US) scans,although advantageous
  due to less acquisition time and safety, is challengingdue to the inherent noisiness
  in US scans, blurry boundaries, and partial livervisibility. We address these challenges
  by using the segmentation masks of afew incomplete sagittal-plane US scans of the
  liver in conjunction with astatistical shape model (SSM) built using a set of CT
  scans of the liver. Wecompute the shape parameters needed to warp this canonical
  SSM to fit the USscans through a parametric regression network. The resulting 3D
  liverreconstruction is accurate and leads to automatic liver volume calculation.
  Weevaluate the accuracy of the estimated liver volumes with respect to CTsegmentation
  volumes using RMSE. Our volume computation is statistically muchcloser to the volume
  estimated using CT scans than the volume computed usingChilds'' method by radiologists:
  p-value of 0.094 (>0.05) says that there is nosignificant difference between CT
  segmentation volumes and ours in contrast toChilds'' method. We validate our method
  using investigations (ablation studies)on the US image resolution, the number of
  CT scans used for SSM, the number ofprincipal components, and the number of input
  US scans. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first automatic liver volumetry
  system using a fewincomplete US scans given a set of CT scans of livers for SSM.'
