description: In the last decade, parameter-free approaches to shape optimization problems
  have matured to a state where they provide a versatile tool for complex engineering
  applications. However, sensitivity distributions obtained from shape derivatives
  in this context cannot be directly used as a shape update in gradient-based optimization
  strategies. Instead, an auxiliary problem has to be solved to obtain a gradient
  from the sensitivity. While several choices for these auxiliary problems were investigated
  mathematically, the complexity of the concepts behind their derivation has often
  prevented their application in engineering. This work aims at an explanation of
  several approaches to compute shape updates from an engineering perspective. We
  introduce the corresponding auxiliary problems in a formal way and compare the choices
  by means of numerical examples. To this end, a test case and exemplary applications
  from computational fluid dynamics are considered.

## Tldr 
In the last decade, parameter-free approaches to shape optimization problems have matured to a state where they provide a versatile tool for complex engineering applications. However, sensitivity distributions obtained from shape derivatives in this context cannot be directly used as a shape update in gradient-based optimization strategies. Instead, an auxiliary problem has to be solved to obtain a gradient from the sensitivity. While several choices for these auxiliary problems were investigated mathematically, the complexity of the concepts behind their derivation has often prevented their application in engineering. This work aims at an explanation of several approaches to compute shape updates from an engineering perspective. We introduce the corresponding auxiliary problems in a formal way and compare the choices by means of numerical examples. To this end, a test case and exemplary applications from computational fluid dynamics are considered.
