description: The exploration of multimodal language models integrates multiple data
  types,such as images, text, language, audio, and other heterogeneity. While thelatest
  large language models excel in text-based tasks, they often struggle tounderstand
  and process other data types. Multimodal models address thislimitation by combining
  various modalities, enabling a more comprehensiveunderstanding of diverse data.
  This paper begins by defining the concept ofmultimodal and examining the historical
  development of multimodal algorithms.Furthermore, we introduce a range of multimodal
  products, focusing on theefforts of major technology companies. A practical guide
  is provided, offeringinsights into the technical aspects of multimodal models. Moreover,
  we presenta compilation of the latest algorithms and commonly used datasets, providingresearchers
  with valuable resources for experimentation and evaluation. Lastly,we explore the
  applications of multimodal models and discuss the challengesassociated with their
  development. By addressing these aspects, this paper aimsto facilitate a deeper
  understanding of multimodal models and their potentialin various domains.
