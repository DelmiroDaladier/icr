description: The rise of renewables coincides with the shift towards Electrical Vehicles(EVs)
  posing technical and operational challenges for the energy balance of thelocal grid.
  Nowadays, the energy grid cannot deal with a spike in EVs usageleading to a need
  for more coordinated and grid aware EVs charging anddischarging strategies. However,
  coordinating power flow from multiple EVs intothe grid requires sophisticated algorithms
  and load-balancing strategies as thecomplexity increases with more control variables
  and EVs, necessitating largeoptimization and decision search spaces. In this paper,
  we propose an EVs fleetcoordination model for the day ahead aiming to ensure a reliable
  energy supplyand maintain a stable local grid, by utilizing EVs to store surplus
  energy anddischarge it during periods of energy deficit. The optimization problem
  isaddressed using Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) considering criteria related toenergy
  grid balancing, time usage preference, and the location of EV drivers.The EVs schedules,
  associated with the position of individuals from thepopulation, are adjusted through
  exploration and exploitation operations, andtheir technical and operational feasibility
  is ensured, while the rabbitindividual is updated with a non-dominated EV schedule
  selected per iterationusing a roulette wheel algorithm. The solution is evaluated
  within theframework of an e-mobility service in Terni city. The results indicate
  thatcoordinated charging and discharging of EVs not only meet balancing servicerequirements
  but also align with user preferences with minimal deviations.
