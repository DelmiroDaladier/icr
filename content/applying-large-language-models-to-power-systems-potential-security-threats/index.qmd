description: Applying large language models (LLMs) to power systems presents a promisingavenue
  for enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency. However, thisaction may
  also incur potential security threats, which have not been fullyrecognized so far.
  To this end, this letter analyzes potential threats incurredby applying LLMs to
  power systems, emphasizing the need for urgent research anddevelopment of countermeasures.
