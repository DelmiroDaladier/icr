  to map and bibliometrically analyze the academic fieldconcerning the relationship
  between Artificial Intelligence, Entrepreneurship,and Finance, and the first review
  that deals with Artificial Intelligencemethods in Entrepreneurship. According to
  the results, Artificial NeuralNetwork, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine

  isquite rare. As an element of the research, and before final remarks, thearticle
  deals as well with a discussion of certain gaps in the relationshipbetween Computer

  Intelligence in Economic Science. As a way to atleast in part remedy this situation,
  the foundational paradigm and the bespokedemonstration of the Monte Carlo randomized
  algorithm are presented.
