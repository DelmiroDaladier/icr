description: The task of annotating data into concise summaries poses a significantchallenge
  across various domains, frequently requiring the allocation ofsignificant time and
  specialized knowledge by human experts. Despite existingefforts to use large language
  models for annotation tasks, significant problemssuch as limited applicability to
  unlabeled data, the absence of self-supervisedmethods, and the lack of focus on
  complex structured data still persist. Inthis work, we propose a GPT self-supervision
  annotation method. This methodembodies a generating-recovering paradigm that leverages
  the capabilities ofone-shot learning capabilities in Generative Pretrained Transformer
  (GPT). Theproposed approach comprises a one-shot tuning phase followed by a generationphase.
  In the one-shot tuning phase, we sample a data from the support set aspart of the
  prompt for GPT to generate a textual summary, which is then used torecover the original
  data. The alignment score between the recovered andoriginal data serves as a self-supervision
  navigator to refine the process. Inthe generation stage, the optimally selected
  one-shot sample serves as atemplate in the prompt and is applied to generating summaries
  from challengingdatasets. The annotation performance is evaluated by tuning several
  humanfeedback reward networks and by calculating alignment scores between originaland
  recovered data at both sentence and structure levels. Our self-supervisedannotation
  method consistently achieves competitive scores, convincinglydemonstrating its robust
  strength in various data-to-summary annotation tasks.
