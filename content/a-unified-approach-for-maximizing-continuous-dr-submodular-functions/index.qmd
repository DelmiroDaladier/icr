description: This paper presents a unified approach for maximizing continuousDR-submodular
  functions that encompasses a range of settings and oracle accesstypes. Our approach
  includes a Frank-Wolfe type offline algorithm for bothmonotone and non-monotone
  functions, with different restrictions on the generalconvex set. We consider settings
  where the oracle provides access to either thegradient of the function or only the
  function value, and where the oracleaccess is either deterministic or stochastic.
  We determine the number ofrequired oracle accesses in all cases. Our approach gives
  new/improved resultsfor nine out of the sixteen considered cases, avoids computationally
  expensiveprojections in two cases, with the proposed framework matching performance
  ofstate-of-the-art approaches in the remaining five cases. Notably, our approachfor
  the stochastic function value-based oracle enables the first regret boundswith bandit
  feedback for stochastic DR-submodular functions.
