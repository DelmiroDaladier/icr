  within the beam search pruningprocess to screen out candidate translations likely
  to cause extensiverevisions, leading to a substantial reduction in flickering and,
  crucially,providing the capability to completely eliminate flickering. The experimentsdemonstrate
  the proposed method can significantly improve the decodingstability without compromising
  substantially on the translation quality.
