description: In this paper, we study the severity of cascading failures in supply
  chainnetworks defined by a node percolation process corresponding to productsuppliers
  failing independently due to systemic shocks. We first show that thesize of the
  cascades follows a power law in random directed acyclic graphs,whose topology encodes
  the natural ordering of products from simple rawmaterials to complex products. This
  motivates the need for a supply chainresilience metric, which we define as the maximum
  magnitude shock that theproduction network can withstand such that at least $(1
  -\varepsilon)$-fraction of the products are produced with high probability asthe
  size of the production network grows to infinity. Next, we study theresilience of
  many network architectures and classify them as resilient, wherelarge cascading
  failures can be avoided almost surely, and as fragile, wherelarge cascades are inevitable.
  In the next step, we give bounds on the expectedsize of cascading failures in a
  given production network graph as the solutionto a linear program and show that
  extending the node percolation process to ajoint percolation process that affects
  the nodes and the links of theproduction network becomes a special instance of the
  well-studied financialcontagion model of Eisenberg and Noe. We show that under certain
  assumptions,the Katz centrality of each node can be used as a measure of theirvulnerability
  and give general lower bounds as well as optimal interventionsfor improving resilience
  as a function of Katz centralities. Finally, tovalidate our theoretical results,
  we empirically calculate the resiliencemetric and study interventions in a variety
  of real-world networks.
