description: The predominant centralized paradigm in educational data management currentlysuffers
  from several critical issues such as vulnerability to malicioustampering, a high
  prevalence of diploma counterfeiting, and the onerous cost ofcertificate authentication.
  Decentralized blockchain technology, with itscutting-edge capabilities, presents
  a viable solution to these pervasiveproblems. In this paper, we illuminate the inherent
  limitations of existingcentralized systems and introduce EduChain, a novel heterogeneousblockchain-based
  system for managing educational data. EduChain uniquelyharnesses the strengths of
  both private and consortium blockchains, offering anunprecedented level of security
  and efficiency. In addition, we propose arobust mechanism for performing database
  consistency checks and error tracing.This is achieved through the implementation
  of a secondary consensus, employingthe pt-table-checksum tool. This approach effectively
  addresses the prevalentissue of database mismatches. Our system demonstrates superior
  performance inkey areas such as information verification, error traceback, and data
  security,thereby significantly improving the integrity and trustworthiness ofeducational
  data management. Through EduChain, we offer a powerful solution forfuture advancements
  in secure and efficient educational data management.
