description: The field of Optimal Control under Partial Differential Equations (PDE)constraints
  is rapidly changing under the influence of Deep Learning and theaccompanying automatic
  differentiation libraries. Novel techniques likePhysics-Informed Neural Networks
  (PINNs) and Differentiable Programming (DP)are to be contrasted with established
  numerical schemes like Direct-AdjointLooping (DAL). We present a comprehensive comparison
  of DAL, PINN, and DP usinga general-purpose mesh-free differentiable PDE solver
  based on Radial BasisFunctions. Under Laplace and Navier-Stokes equations, we found
  DP to beextremely effective as it produces the most accurate gradients; thriving
  evenwhen DAL fails and PINNs struggle. Additionally, we provide a detailedbenchmark
  highlighting the limited conditions under which any of those methodscan be efficiently
  used. Our work provides a guide to Optimal Controlpractitioners and connects them
  further to the Deep Learning community.
