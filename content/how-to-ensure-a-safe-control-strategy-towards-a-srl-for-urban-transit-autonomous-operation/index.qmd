Deep reinforcement learning has gradually shown its latent decision-makingability in urban rail transit autonomous operation. However, sincereinforcement learning can not neither guarantee safety during learning norexecution, this is still one of the major obstacles to the practicalapplication of reinforcement learning. Given this drawback, reinforcementlearning applied in the safety-critical autonomous operation domain remainschallenging without generating a safe control command sequence that avoidsoverspeed operations. Therefore, a SSA-DRL framework is proposed in this paperfor safe intelligent control of urban rail transit autonomous operation trains.The proposed framework is combined with linear temporal logic, reinforcementlearning and Monte Carlo tree search and consists of four mainly module: apost-posed shielding, a searching tree module, a DRL framework and anadditional actor. Furthermore, the output of the framework can meet speedconstraint, schedule constraint and optimize the operation process. Finally,the proposed SSA-DRL framework for decision-making in urban rail transitautonomous operation is evaluated in sixteen different sections, and itseffectiveness is demonstrated through an ablation experiment and comparisonwith the scheduled operation plan.
