description: This paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR),
  apromising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three)to
  generate accurate and diverse recommendations, and takes into account thesequential
  nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systemsoften depends on
  the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In thisdynamic landscape, the
  problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneousknowledge between dissimilar
  domains leads to performance degradation due todifferences in user preferences across
  these domains. As a remedy, we propose anew CDSR framework that addresses the problem
  of negative transfer by assessingthe extent of negative transfer from one domain
  to another and adaptivelyassigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction
  losses. To thisend, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the
  marginalcontribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative
  gametheory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach thatincorporates
  information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into thatof fine-level
  categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastivelearning was developed
  to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentiallylow relevance between domains
  at the fine-level, there may be higher relevanceat the category level due to its
  generalised and broader preferences. We showthat our model is superior to prior
  works in terms of model performance on tworeal-world datasets across ten different
  domains.
